In a world facing environmental catastrophe, there are few places where there is still hope. New Zealand--isolated, pristine, pure. A place for the future.

Where people can dream about a better way. Dream of a Sanctuary. This documentary will follow seven families over a period of one year in extraordinary unspoilt landscapes. 

Capturing the good times, as well as the hardships which they face. 

To find Sanctuary.
